Scanner
=======

Batch IP scanner and port scanner

  Written in Python and utilizing wx UI. Uses multi threading to ping a range of IP addresses. This is my first time using wx 
or any UI and one of my first programs using threading. 
  
  Todo:
    -fix/catch overflow problem with inputting too many ips in ip address range\n
    -bind timer option on ip scanner to actual function
    -add saving features
    -fix layout problems
    -use realtime ports/sec, ips/sec to calculate estimated time left
    -display realtime count of open threads
    -add config feature for things like thread count
    -combine reduntant classes from ipscann/portscan to common source
